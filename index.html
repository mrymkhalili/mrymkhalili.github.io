                The force is not only about lifting rocks (as most people think). 
                Watch the video to see a brand new magic hand trick from your favorite star.
                Baby Yoda and my Rubik's cubes were my friends in quarantine. 
                My classmates and I made this video virtually over Zoom in 1 hour. 
                We were five people and none of us had met one another before. 
                After chatting for ten minutes, we figured that three people loved Star Wars and three people liked Rubik's. 
                Ten more minutes and we created the storyline. I hope you enjoy it :)

                Life is not easy these days, but it certainly wasn’t easy hundreds of thousands of years ago when we lived in caves. 
                <br>
                Roots is a survival web comic that’s portrayed as cave art. 
                It follows the story of a caveman who has to make a series of careful decisions every day in order to survive.
                <br><br><br>
                But it’s not easy living in the wild world, is it? Would YOU survive?
