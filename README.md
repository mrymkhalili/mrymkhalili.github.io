- Project Name: Maryam Khalili's portfolio

- Project Description: This is my personal portfolio. I'm very excited to add my designs and comics and other projects from this class to the projects' section. I must mention
that the design on top of the page (in the header section) is not mine and is just a placeholder while I'm working on my own design (I have zero skills and 
experience, but am very interested and excited about it). I changed the theme a lot, tried different color combinations, played around with the boxes a lot,
and everything is still subject to change. But I want to keep it simple and minimal.


- Process: I always start with the CSS file because when I start with HTML everything looks so weird. I also change my mind during the process, so a deadline 
always helps me settle with one theme/idea.


- Reflection/Evaluation: I need to work a lot on adding some interactivity to my website, but I like how things turned out to be so far :)
